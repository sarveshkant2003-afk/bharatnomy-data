# Irrigated area by crop, by state, 2015-16 to 2024-25

From the Ministry of Agriculture's annual land use publication. Areas in thousand hectares (`_000_ha`) unless the column ends in `_pct`.

## Source

## Columns

`state_ut`, then `year` (agricultural year, July-June).

One column per crop, e.g. `rice_000_ha`. `total_*` columns are the publication's subtotals.

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `lgd_state_code` | State/UT code in the Local Government Directory (LGD), from [`_reference/geography.csv`](../_reference/geography.csv). Blank for All India and for old units LGD no longer lists |
| `source_flag` | `provisional` = year printed with `(p)` |
| `source_marks` | Symbols printed next to a number, as `<column>:<symbol>`. `*` is not explained by the source; bracketed numbers are area included in the total without a crop-wise split |

## Notes

- Blank cells are blank in the publication; they are not zeros.
- `lgd_state_code` added on 5 Nov 2026 from the LGD directory (see [`_reference/README.md`](../_reference/README.md)). LGD codes identify today's state or district; for years before a split (Telangana 2014, Ladakh 2019, new districts) the same code covers a larger area than it does now.
